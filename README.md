# CFMC Dashboard
This dashboard is for the use of the Board of Directors of the [Community Foundation of Middlesex County](https://middlesexcountycf.org). Trends in the incoming funds and the outgoing grants will be analyzed with the interactive visualizations on this dashboard. Eventually, a community-facing version will be constructed.
